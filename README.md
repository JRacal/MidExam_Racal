# MidExam_Racal

1. Create a repository in your GitHub account and name it MidExam_Surname. Clone the repository and do the following: 
    •	Create an Ansible playbook that does the following with an input of a config.yaml file and arranged Inventory file:

    •	Install and configure Elastic Stack in separate  hosts (Elastic Search, Kibana, Logstash)

    •	Install Nagios in one host

    •	Install Grafana, Prometheus and Influxdb in seperate hosts (Influxdb,Grafana,Prometheus)

    •	Install Lamp Stack in separate hosts (Httpd + Php,Mariadb)

    •	Show Elastic Search Website Accessed to browser

  2. Document all the tasks here using MSWord. (When I say document, that means you need to show proof of all the activities, including creating screenshots, proper labeling, and explanations.) 
  3. Document the push, and commit from the local repository to GitHub. 
  4. Finally, paste also the link of your GitHub repository in the documentation

In this Activity we have to install the given tasks and the reason/purpose is ELK Stack, helps by providing users with a powerful platform that collects and processes data from multiple data sources, stores that data in one centralized data store that can scale as data grows, and that provides a set of tools to analyze the data. Nagios, It keeps an inventory of your servers and monitors them so you know your critical services are up and running. Grafana, It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources. Prometheus, it can scrape metrics from jobs directly or, for short-lived jobs by using a push gateway when the job exits. The scraped samples are stored locally and rules are applied to the data to aggregate and generate new time series from existing data or generate alerts based on user-defined triggers. Influxdb, It is written in the Go programming language for storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, Internet of Things sensor data, and real-time analytics. and Lamp Stack, it provide a proven set of software for delivering high-performance web applications.
